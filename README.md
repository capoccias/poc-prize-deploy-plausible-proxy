# Plausible Analytics Proxy for fly.io

This is a simple NGINX setup for [proxying Plausible](https://plausible.io/docs/proxy/guides/nginx). Note that this is not the self-hosting setup. It just forwards requests to Plausible in order to minimize data loss.

## Getting started

1. Adjust the app name
2. `fly launch`
